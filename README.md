# Useful Tools for SoHacks Hackers #

Ask a programmer what tools to use in a certain situation and you are bound to get ***thousands*** back in response. So to help you get started with your projects we came up with a list of tools to make your life easier.

---
The types of software listed are:
* IDE's (Integrated Development Enviroment)
* Text Editors
* Game/Rendering Engines
* Photo Editing Software
* CAD Software (Computer Aided Design)
* Audio Recording/Editing Software
* Cloud Hosting

So lets get started!

---
#### IDE's ####
1. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) - Used for creating apps that run on the Android family of devices.
2. [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/) - Used to code just about anything from Java, C, and C++ to websites.
3. [Xcode (Mac Only)](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - This software is made by Apple for developing apps for their operating systems.

---
#### Text Editors ####
1. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - A clean simple program for editing any sort of file with color coding for any type of programming language. Its like the ticonderoga pencil of programming tools.
2. [Atom](https://atom.io/) - A more modern text editor with some extra bells and whistles developed by Github. If sublime is the pencil, this is the fountain pen.
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Microsoft's version of Atom with some added support for Microsoft Services. The fancy mechanical pencil of text editors.
4. [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - I now present you the swiss army knife of all programming tools. Pretty sure it has existed since the dawn of time and you can tell because its all keyboard based and rather difficult to learn. But if you take the time to learn how to use it, you'll be unstoppable.

#### Game/Rendering Engines ####
1. [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/) - Wonderful tool for creating any type of game, animation, video or virtual reality (especially Google Cardboard) project with support to automatically generate code for Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android, fricken Samsung Smart TVs!!!!! You name it, Unity does it. (Also has a wonderful community for support and documentation for all your leaning needs)
2. [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4) Another wonderful engine that does everything mentioned above (I don't know about the smart tv but I don't think that's a deal breaker) 
3. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) While Blender is not a game engine, its can be used to render scenery, create 3D models, add color to models, animate just about anything, or even edit photos. It does just about anything and is a great tool to be used along side a game engine to create some truly amazing visuals and designs.

---
#### Photo Editing ####
1. [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) - The G.N.U. Image Manipulation Program. ***Free*** photoshop, do I need to say more?

---
#### CAD Software ####
1. [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/) - A basic easy to use program for creating and editing 3D models and designs. The Toyota Camry of CAD Software, it does was it needs to without all the bells and whistles.
2. [AutoCAD](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview) - Created by AutoDesk, this is the Rolls Royce of CAD Software. They offer free 14 day trials, and free 3 year licenses to students (can be found by searching AudoDesk Education on google)

---
#### Audio Recording/Editing ####
1. [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) - Used for recording audio, editing sound clips, and exporting audio to a different format. A great all around audio tool.

---
#### Misc. ####
1. [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - An IDE used to create programs for Arduino devices. If you are looking to make a hardware based project this is a great way to go!
2. [Processing](https://processing.org/) - Powerful tool for turning code into art. Used mainly to take data from an Arduino device and use that to manipulate images within the program.
3. [IDLE](https://www.python.org/) - This IDE comes bundled when you install Python onto your computer and is a great way to sandbox code or test full programs when using the command line is not your thing.

###### A Note On Cloud Hosting ######
If you are looking for a way to host your webpage or web application there are a few ways for you to do this that are entirely free and we wanted to make you aware of. First you have Github Pages, this will allow you to host any ***Static*** webpage (html, css, and javascript) for free using [github username].github.io for your domain name. If you own a custom domain name that can be added and used just by adding a single file with the new name and doing some linking with your domain provider (Like Google Domains). Secondly, there is Red Hat Openshift, a cloud hosting program with a free tier available to everyone. Created by Red Hat, the company behind one of the most popular Linux Distributions

for... businesses... um okay back to what I was saying... Openshift allows you to host software built using node.js, python, ruby, angular, etc. Think of it as a way to put added functionality to a website. For example the SoHacks Bot on Slack is a program I wrote and am hosting through an Openshift node.js server. Put both Github Pages and Openshift together and you can create some amazing web based software, but can also be used if you just want to make a webpage talking about the software you have created!
